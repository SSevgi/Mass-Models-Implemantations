# Mass-Models-Implemantations
In modeling cognitive process, mass models are utilized to exhibit the behavior of a neuron population. These models are not only used for understanding the neural behavior behind cognitive processes, but also can be exploited in brain-computer interface research and in the study of certain neurological diseases. 

In this study, a reduced equivalent to the well-known Jansen-Rit mass model which is employed for modeling the cortex is proposed. The proposed model is based on the Wilson-Cowan model and has connections same as Jansen-Rit mass model. Thanks to the new model, the results obtained from the 6-dimensional equations of Jansen-Rit have been obtained in 3 dimensions. It has been shown that the proposed reduced mass model can be used to obtain frequencies related to brain dynamics using much lower computational cost. 

REDUCED MASS MODEL:

With changing tau_i and tau_e values, model oscillation y(t) frequency changes and create corresponding brain dynamics.


|$\tau_e$ = $\tau_i$ | Brain dynamics |  Frequency [Hz] |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| 0.18 -  0.05       |   $\delta $    |     1-4         |
| 0.05 - 0.025       |  $\theta $     |     4-8         |
| 0.025 - 0.015      |  $\alpha $     |     8-12        |
| 0.015 - 0.055      |  $\beta $      |     12-30       |
| 0.055              |  $\gamma$      |     30+         |
